        <p>"If you take time to realize what your dream is and what you really want in life no matter what it is, whether it's sports or in other fields you have to realize that there is always work to do, and you want to be the hardest working person in whatever you do, and you put yourself in a position to be successful. And you have to have a passion about what you do."  - Stephen Curry</p>
